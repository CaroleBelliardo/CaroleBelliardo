# CaroleBelliardo 

ðŸ”­ My primary research interests include:
- Bioinformatics with specialization in genomics and metagenomics.
- High-throughput genome sequencing.
- Horizontal gene transfers.
- Evolution of plant pathogen genomesðŸŒ± .
- Comparative genomics.
  
I am harnessing next-generation sequencing data to explore intricate topics such as the evolution of plant pathogen genomes, horizontal gene transfer in metazoan genomes, and the microbial diversity in both environmental and host-associated contexts.
